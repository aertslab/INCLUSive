* VERSION 3.0, released 2003/10/07

* ABOUT INCLUSive * 
  This is the distribution of the INCLUSive motif finding library and
  application. It contains a set of applications that can be used to search 
  for potential transcription factor 
  
* INSTALLATION *
  The INCLUSive Motif finding package <INCLUSive-3.0.tar.gz> can be downloaded 
  from the BioI@SCD website: 
    http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~dna/BioI/Software.html
  
  Unzip and untar the package
    gunzip INCLUSive-3.0.tar.gz
    tar xvf INCLUSive-3.0.tar
    
  Go to the package directory and compile the package. 
    cd INCLUSive-3.0
    ./configure 
    make
    make install
  
  By default package will installed under /usr/local, ifr you like the program 
  to be installed under another directory, use the following commands
    cd INCLUSive-3.0
    ./configure --prefix=/my/installation/dir 
    make

* APPLICATIONS *
  
  1. CreateBackgroundModel
    Program to create an INCLUSive background model from a set of sequences in
    FASTA format. 

    Usage example:
    CreateBackgroundModel -f yeast_seq.tfa -b yeast_o3.bg -o 3 -m 'yeast'
    
    
  2. BackgroundScore
    Score individual sequences in FASTA format with the given background model.
  
    Usage example:
     BackgroundScore -f seq.tfa -b myModel.bg
   
   
  3. MotifSampler
    Original motif finding algorithm. 
  
    Usage example:
    MotifSampler -f seq.tfa -b myModel.bg -o feat.gff -m pwm.mtrx -p 0.5 -W 8 
                -r 100 -n 3 
                
                
  4. MotifRanking
    Program to make a selection of the top scoring motifs. At first the 
    matrices are ranked according to their scores. Next the best scoring is 
    selected and all similar motifs are removed from the list. This procedure
    is repeated untill the requested number of motifs is selected.
    
    Usage example:
     MotifRanking -i pwms.mtrx -o top10_pwms.mtrx -r 10 -t 0.4 
    
    
  5. MotifComparison
    Program to compare different motifs. The Kullback-Leiber distance is used
    to quantify the similarity between two motifs:
      d(M1,M2) = 1/W[sum_1^W (M1 log(M1/M2) + M2 log(M2/M1))]
    If M1 and M2 are the same this measure is 0. To compensate for potential 
    shifts and differences in length between M1 and M2 the distance is computed 
    for the overlapping part and the minimal score is reported. Those motifs 
    for which the score is smaller than the given threshold are retained.
    
    Usage example:
     MotifComparison -m pwm.mtrx -d pwmDB.mtrx -s 2 -t 0.4 -o list.txt

  6. MotifScanner
    Program to screen individual sequences for instances of a known motif. To 
    detect the motif instances a probabilistic sequence model is used, where 
    instances are hidden in a noisy background model. This means that the 
    context of sequence inwhich these instances are hidden is taken into account.

    Usage example:
     MotifScanner -f seq.tfa -b myModel.bg -m pwms.mtrx -o feat.gff -p 0.5 
     
  7. MotifLocator
    Program to screen individual sequences for instances of a known motif 
    based on a classical weight matrix scoring scheme. 
    
    Usage example:
     MotifLocator -f seq.tfa -b myModel.bg -m pwms.mtrx -o feat.gff -t 0.95
   
  8. PhyloSampler (experimental)
    not yet fully completed
  9. PriorMotifSampler (experimental)
    not yet fully completed    


* INCLUSive FILE FORMATS *

  1. Motif file
    Below you can find an example of the motif file. The matrix description 
    file starts with a header line. Next comes each matrix representation of 
    the motif model which is preceded with the description lines. There are 
    four different tags: ID, Score, W (= width of the motif) and Consensus.
    The motif model is given as a position-specific frequency matrix where the 
    columns are in the order A, C, G and T.

  2. Background model
    Below you can find an example of a file with the first-order background
    model built from the upstream sequences in yeast. The first line is always
    the INCLUSive header. Then there are several tags that describe the 
    background model: Order, Organism and Sequences.
    Next follow the parameters of the background model. First the single 
    nucleotide frequency, then the oligonucleotide frequency and finally the
    transition matrix.
